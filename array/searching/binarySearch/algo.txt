Steps to use Binary Search Algorithm:

1. Sort the array(ascending order in this case)
2. Get the middle element of the array.
3. Three cases arrive:
    3.1. The middle element is the query element.
        Simply return the element.
    3.2. The middle element is greter than query element.
        Take the first half of the array as the new array and go to step 2
    3.3. The middle element is less than query element.
        Take the second half of the array as the new array and go to step 2
4. keep doing step 2 and step 3 as long as first index <= last index
